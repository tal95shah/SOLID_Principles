# Single Responsibility Principle

## Definition

Every class or module should have responsibility over a single part of functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class or module.

Everything in the class or module should be related to the single purpose.

## Motivation

* Maintainability
* Loose Coupling
* Flexibility and Extensibility
* Parallel Development
* Testability 


## Without Single Responsibility
